The Excel file in this folder presents the raw numerical results for the Actin polymerization experiment. 

It contains the data, not shown in the manuscript, referred to (twice) in the below sentences of the main text:
`The fluorescence of pyrene actin (360 nm excitation and emission at 420 nm) was measured at baseline (3 min), after exposure to the ambient geomagnetic field or to the MF 
(480 muT for 20 min, data not shown in this manuscript but deposited in Github), and after incubation with polymerization buffer during 1 h in the absence or presence of the same weak MF. 
Stimulation with the MF in the absence of a polymerization buffer does not affect the fluorescence level (data not shown in this manuscript but deposited in Github).'
